Using your stories to drive selenium is a breeze when you are using the webrat story steps. You need to do some legwork first by installing the items:

A.) Install selenium plugin from github
    CLONE @ git://github.com/wolfdancer/selenium.git

* Make sure you have Firefox installed in /Applications/Firefox.app (!)

For now you have to run the stories by hand.  Now let's get started.

First we need a story. Any story will do. Currently each story has a 'story.txt' file and a 'story_spec.rb' file. 
We will add a 'story_selenium_spec.rb' for the story we want to run through selenium. 
(An example is provided by the plugin but manually changing the 'webrat_helper' to 'selenium_helper' also does the trick)

1.) Run './script/generate stories' again if you installed the previous version without selenium support. It will add the helper to your stories directory.

2.) Kickstart the selenium server: 'rake selenium:start' this will start selenium, and run script/server with the correct arguments (-e test -p 3800 --debugger)

3.) Now run your story: 'ruby stories/story_selenium_spec.rb'
