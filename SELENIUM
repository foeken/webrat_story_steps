Special thanks: Notch8 for making the rake stuff work like it should

NOTE: All this has only been tested under osx
NOTE: Updating from previous version? Remove the selenium-specr plugin!

Using your stories to drive selenium is a breeze when you are using the webrat story steps. You need to do some legwork first by installing the items:

A.) Install selenium plugin from github
    CLONE @ git://github.com/wolfdancer/selenium.git

* Make sure you have Firefox installed in /Applications/Firefox.app (!)

For now you have to run the stories by hand.  Now let's get started.

First we need a story. Any story will do. Currently each story has a 'story.txt' file and a 'story_spec.rb' file. 
We no longer need to add anything to the story to run via selenium.

1.) Run './script/generate stories' again if you installed the previous version without selenium support. It will add the helper to your stories directory.

2.) Start selenium server and mongrel/webrick: 'rake selenium:start'
    This will start selenium, and run script/server with the correct arguments (-e test -p 3000 --debugger)

3.) Now run your story with the SELENIUM variable set: 'SELENIUM=true ruby stories/story_spec.rb'

NOTE: If you want specific environment stuff in your selenium session just create a selenium environment / database config and it will default to that.
